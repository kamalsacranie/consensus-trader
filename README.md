# Consensus trader

Thus far I have created a neat little multithreaded Reddit scraper which looks
for stock tickers using regex.

The natural language processing is yet to be implemented but I think it's
trivial once a list of words is collated and you are able to weight comments.

Arguably, in fact, definitely should have used SQL to manage my database instead
of dataframes but this was pre my `sqlalchemy` days.
